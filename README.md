# Acme

VS Code theme inspired by the [Acme editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_%28text_editor%29). 

One big difference from the original Acme editor is that comments and strings are highlighted in respective shades of gray.
The other is that the editor colors are slightly muted to accomodate modern displays.
