# Acme

VS Code theme inspired by the [Acme editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_%28text_editor%29). 

Two big differences between this theme and the original Acme editor's color scheme:
1. Comments are highlighted in respective shades of off-gray.
2. Some colors are tweaked to accommodate modern displays.

A blue and white version of the theme is also included.
