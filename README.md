# Acme

VS Code theme inspired by the [Acme editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_%28text_editor%29). 

Two big differences between this theme and the original Acme editor's color scheme:

1. Comments are a faded foreground color.
2. Some other editor and/or UI colors are slightly muted, which looks better in VS Code on modern displays (IMHO).

A blue and white variant of the theme is also included (experimental).
